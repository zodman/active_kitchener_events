# Idea

It's summer and now the kids are free from the school.

I write this python script for list all the events available from the Community
Center near to me: [Breithaupt Centre](https://anc.ca.apm.activecommunities.com/activekitchener/activity/search?onlineSiteId=0&locale=en-US&activity_select_param=0&center_ids=4&open_spots=1&viewMode=list).

I hate the filter website, For that reason; I want to see by days all the events.
