# Idea

It's summer and now the kids are free from the school.

I write this python script for list all the events available from the Community
Center near to me: Breithaupt Centre.

I hate the filter website, For that reason; I want to see by days all the events.

# for install

```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# for execute

```
python main.py


```
